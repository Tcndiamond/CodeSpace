üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The content of this repository is organized into two folders: Day 1 and Day 2. Each folder contains the respective lessons covered on those days, presented in Jupyter Notebook format.

The main notebook, titled Python Workshop Notebookipynb, contains all the consolidated code examples from both days. It serves as the central reference for everything covered during the workshop.

Additionally, the Exercises.ipynb notebook provides a curated list of exercises designed to reinforce the concepts taught. These exercises are intended to give you hands-on practice and help you apply what you have learned.
